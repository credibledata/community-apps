# Maps

When the data has places, draw them. A choropleth of states, counties or countries answers "where" at a glance, and
a click on a place filters the app or opens its page. Boundaries ship as TopoJSON, which is text, and are drawn by the
chart module's `choropleth` with d3 and topojson-client. Every file is pinned and checked, like d3. Data with
coordinates and no boundaries (a complaint's latitude and longitude) is drawn with `hexMap`, below.

## Which boundaries

| Places in the data | File | Object | Key on each shape | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| US states | `us-atlas@3.0.1/states-albers-10m.json` | `states` | `id`: 2-digit FIPS (`"36"`); `properties.name` (`"New York"`) | 82 KB |
| US counties | `us-atlas@3.0.1/counties-albers-10m.json` | `counties` (borders: `states`) | `id`: 5-digit FIPS (`"36061"`) | 795 KB |
| Countries | `world-atlas@2.0.2/countries-110m.json` | `countries` | `id`: ISO 3166-1 numeric (`"840"`); `properties.name` | 108 KB |

The US files are already projected (Albers USA, Alaska and Hawaii inset) to a 975 by 610 box; the world file is in
longitude and latitude and is projected with Equal Earth. Match on FIPS or ISO codes when the data has them; names
differ between sources ("Côte d'Ivoire", "Ivory Coast"), so when you join on names, list every name that found no
shape, and fix them in the model, not in the app. Counties are large: use them only when the data is by county, and put a ranked table beside the map, since county
shapes take no keyboard focus.
Canadian provinces and other regions have no packaged open file here; draw those as a ranked table instead.

## Vendor

d3 is already in the page (`reference/charts.md`). Copy topojson-client from the templates, and fetch the one
boundary file the app needs:

```sh
T=$(ls -d /workspace/siblings/*/templates/data-app | head -1)
mkdir -p public/vendor/maps && chmod -R u+w public && cp "$T"/vendor/topojson-client.min.js public/vendor/ && chmod -R u+w public
cd public/vendor

curl -sSL --fail --max-time 60 -o maps/states-albers-10m.json $base/us-atlas@3.0.1/states-albers-10m.json
curl -sSL --fail --max-time 60 -o maps/LICENSE-atlas.txt $base/us-atlas@3.0.1/LICENSE

cd ../..
```

The other two boundary files, with their sums:

```
a674dfa31b625e92635f32684a61ae135b05a91507f17f2d5164833237fecf46  maps/counties-albers-10m.json   (us-atlas@3.0.1)

```

Never keep a file whose sum differs. Add to `public/vendor/README.md`: topojson-client 3.1.0, ISC license, by Mike
Bostock; the boundary file, ISC license, from us-atlas (US Census Bureau cartographic boundaries, public domain) or
world-atlas (Natural Earth, public domain). Credit the boundaries in About the data. Load topojson-client after d3:
`<script src="./vendor/topojson-client.min.js"></script>`.

## Drawing a map

A tile draws a choropleth like this; the SVG keeps its proportions as the width changes:

```js
draw: ([rows], body) => C.loadTopo('./vendor/maps/states-albers-10m.json').then((topo) =>
  C.choropleth(chartBox(body), topo, new Map(rows.map((r) => [r.state, r.production])), {
    object: 'states', legendTitle: 'Million lb', selected: scope.state, onPick: (s) => toggleScope('state', s),
  })),
```

The legend's classes are quintiles of the values shown; say so in the tile's method note.

Points with coordinates go on `hexMap`: one row per location with its count, `group_by: lat, lon` with a `limit` above
the number of locations (a query without one stops at the server's default row cap), and the same query with no
filters as `opts.base`, drawn grey underneath so the place keeps its shape. It needs no boundary file. Its hexagons are
clicked, not tabbed to: put a ranked table beside it.
